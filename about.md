I am a PhD student in Department of Computer Science at University of Pittsburgh.

My research interests are in machine learning. Currently I am working on developing new methods in Recurrent Neural Networks and lower-dimensional embeddings for predicting discrete events in time series data. 
My research advisor is [Dr. Milos Hauskrecht](http://cs.pitt.edu/~jlee).
